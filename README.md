Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have about 5 years of computational biology experience, 4 years of molecular cancer biology, and 4 years of immunology experience.

I am a computational biologist working on (single-cell and bulk) genomics, epigenomics, and (spatial) transcriptomic.

I use machine learning (ML) approaches to find new drug targets for cancer patients;

I use R primarily for data wrangling and visualization in the tidyverse ecosystem;

I use Python for writing processing workflows and reformatting data;

I care about reproducible research and open science.
